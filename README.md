# NTUA Deep Learning Group (NTUA-DLG)

## What is NTUA-DLG?

NTUA-DLG is an effort started by a few PhD students in NTUA
to acquire and share knowledge about Deep Learning theory 
and applications. 

We will host meetup style meetings, where we will discuss
everything we find interesting, from the latest and greatest 
papers on deep learning frontiers to guides about how to 
implement a deep learning pipeline.

## What topics we will cover?

- Basic deep learning theory  
- Deep learning applications on NLP, Computer Vision, Audio processing and more  
- Deep learning frameworks and industry practices

This list of topics will get shaped by the group members depending on how much 
interest is shown about a topic.

## Can I attend?

Off course. Currently we are in the process of kickstarting the group and taking
care of the technical issues (finding the time and place).

We will post the latest updates about our meetings on github.

## What is the purpose of the github repo?

In this repo we will host:
- Tutorials / excerise solutions from the tutorial sessions  
- A curated list of deep learning resources covered in our sessions  
- Code and resources developed in our sessions  
- Meeting minutes in the form of a blog
